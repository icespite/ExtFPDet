We release the honeypage dataset used for training. The JavaScript files in this dataset are sourced from two places: JavaScript files crawled using a modified version of OpenWPM, and files manually crafted by us. 

The `label.csv` file contains filenames and labels, where a label of 1 indicates a honeypage file. The dataset is stored in the `data` folder.
